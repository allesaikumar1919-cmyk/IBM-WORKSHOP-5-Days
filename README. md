### Food Donation & Surplus Food Management System 
This project focuses on creating a web-based platform that connects food donors with NGOs and 
volunteers. The website enables users to post surplus food and helps NGOs locate and collect it 
efficiently, reducing food waste and supporting people in need.

### ◻ 3. Tools Used 
This website was developed using Wix, a no-code website builder that allows easy drag-and
drop design and custom functionality. 
Additional tools/features used: 
 Wix Forms (for food posting and NGO contact) 
 Wix Maps (for location integration) 
 Wix Dashboard (for admin management) 
 Wix Database Collections (for storing food listings)

### Prompt used to build a website 
```
“Build a complete Food Donation and Surplus Food Management website using Wix.
The website should serve as a platform that connects food donors (restaurants, events, households) with NGOs and volunteers.
Design the website with clear navigation, mobile responsiveness, and a clean social-impact theme.
Create the following pages: Home, Donate Food, NGO Finder, How It Works, About Us, and Contact.

Home Page:

Display the mission of reducing food waste and feeding the needy.

Add a call-to-action button: ‘Donate Surplus Food’.

Include sections explaining hunger issues, food waste statistics, and social benefits.

Donate Food Page:

Build a structured donation form using Wix Forms or Wix Database.

Fields should include donor name, type of food, quantity, prepared time, expiry time, address, contact number, pickup instructions, and optional image upload.

Store all submissions into a dedicated Wix Collection called “FoodListings”.

After submission, show a confirmation message and route donors back to the homepage.

NGO Finder Page:

Integrate Wix Maps to display nearby NGOs using pinned markers.

Allow NGOs to add their location through a separate form stored in a “NGOList” database.

Show all NGO entries with details like name, area, phone number, and availability.

Add search or filter options by location or type of service.

Database and Backend Setup:

Create two Wix Collections: “FoodListings” and “NGOList”.

Configure permissions so NGOs can view listings but only admins can modify or delete.

Set up dataset connections on pages to dynamically display real-time posted food listings.

Food Status & Management:

Add a status field (Available / Collected / Expired).

Use Wix automation or manual admin control to update expired posts.

Enable NGOs to contact donors directly using details shown on each listing.

Design Requirements:

Use a minimal, modern color palette with impactful charity-related icons.

Add section transitions, hover animations, and card-style display for listings.

Ensure layout is responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Additional Features:

Add a ‘How It Works’ section with a step-by-step process: Post Food → View on Map → NGO Collects → Distributed to Needy.

Include a volunteer registration form.

Add a small blog section sharing stories, awareness posts, and donor impact.

Overall Goal:
Create a functional and visually appealing platform that makes food donation simple, accessible, and efficient for society, using Wix’s no-code tools and database capabilities.”**
